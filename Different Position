Given two equal length lists of unique numbers, write a function to return 
the number of items in these two lists that have the same values but are at 
the different positions. For example, if these two lists are [1, 2, 3, 5] 
and [2, 1, 3, 4], then the output is 2 because the same values 1 and 
2 appear at the different positions.

def different_position(list1:list, list2:list):
  count = 0
  for i in range(len(list1)):
    for j in range(len(list2)):
      if i!=j and list1[i] == list2[j]:
        count+=1
  return count
